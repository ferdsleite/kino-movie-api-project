## ü§î About The Project

**Kino** is a modern movie discovery platform built to showcase my commitment to mastering the **Next.js** framework and advanced front-end development patterns. This project serves as a key piece in my portfolio as I transition into a dedicated front-end role.

The application allows users to view and navigate the latest film releases by leveraging a public API endpoint, providing a clean, responsive, and intuitive user experience.

My primary goal with Kino was to move beyond foundational concepts and directly apply industry-standard technologies, focusing on:

* Implementing **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Client-Side Components** in Next.js for optimized performance and SEO.
* Enforcing code quality and structure through **TypeScript**.
* Creating a fully **responsive and modern UI** using the utility-first approach of **Tailwind CSS**.

This project demonstrates my ability to rapidly integrate new, complex technologies and deliver a robust, functional, and visually appealing application.
